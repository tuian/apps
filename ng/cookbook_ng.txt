XMLHTTPRequest Object...


php,jsp,ASP.NET MVC C#,


var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
XMLHttpRequest object is available native to the browers.
This was intially created by microsoft, for Outlook webacces..
what happens inside the XMLHttpRequest code is that it can make request to the webserver, without refreshing the page, button clicks etc.
basically go out and get data behind the scene..

xhr is a bit complex to use, thats why we have jquery has Ajax wrapper around it..
